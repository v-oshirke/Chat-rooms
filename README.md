# Chat-rooms

The system must allow users to create and maintain private chat rooms that are accessible and visible only to them.
The system must allow restriction of group chats within a room to specific employees or groups, ensuring access control over sensitive data (RBC).
Each group chat should have a designated owner responsible for managing user access and permissions within the chat room.
